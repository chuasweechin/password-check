# Password Checker

A safer Internet for the win! Check if your password has been pwned by using this extension.

The Password Checker hashes your password and sends the first 5 characters of that hash to the pwned passwords API. It then gets back a list of possible matches and compares your password to that list. Your actual password or hash is never sent over the Internet to the API. No one will know what you have actually typed into the box. Check out more details at https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs.
